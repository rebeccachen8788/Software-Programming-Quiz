# Citation Scope: Based on flask-started-app database folder in github, from osu-cs340-ecampus , scope of code is the whole code in the source to setup the database connection, aka whole module below.
# Date: January 25, 2024
# Originality: Copied, we copied all of the osu-cs340-ecampus flask starter code, all of the code
# below is from the starter code given to the class for CS340, to be used in Capstone.
